Shadowrun Character Roll Automation Machine
A graphical system for managing characters.
This system will have the following features at a minimum:
1. Create character objects that can be saved or printed.
2. Use game rules to roll skill checks.
3. Activate multiple saved characters for use during gameplay.
4. Track every aspect of a character from basic stats to inventory and contacts.
 
That's it for now.
